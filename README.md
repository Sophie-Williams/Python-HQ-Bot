### Analysis

Assuming there are 3 answers for a total of 12 questions, guessing randomly would produce odds of 1/531,441, or a **0.000738328866%** chance of winning.

Considering the first 3 questions are *generally* extremely easy, that would bring the odds down to 1/19,683, or a **0.00508052634%** chance of winning.

## Ideal Scenario

**8 Answers Correct**

**49 Players**

Gives the probability of 49/81, or a **60.4938272%** chance of winning.

Look for the ability to *eliminate* answers rather than find them...
